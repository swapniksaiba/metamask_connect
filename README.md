# wallet

A new Flutter project.

This is a simple flutter web application which can connect to your metamask wallet with a single click

Dependencies used:
- provider
- flutter_web3

This application is done as a task and was developed within less than half day...so it just satisfies the tasks and is barely functional in other cases :!

To run the project:
- Execute following command in terminal at project folder 
"flutter run -d web-server"

# metamask_wallet
